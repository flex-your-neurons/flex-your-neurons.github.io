# Which Item Types Can Be Generated *and* Verified Automatically?

Companion to [`IQ-TESTS.md`](./IQ-TESTS.md). This is the decision document that selects what the
site actually implements.

---

## 1. The three tests an item type must pass

An item type ships only if it passes all three:

**G — Generatable.** A program can produce a fresh, novel instance from a seed, without any
copyrighted stimulus and without a human authoring content.

**V — Verifiable.** The correct answer is *derived from the generating rule*, not looked up in
a hand-made key. The generator knows the answer because it constructed it.

**U — Unambiguous.** Exactly one option is defensible. This is the hard one, and it is where
naive generators fail. Two failure modes:

- **Under-determination** — the stimulus admits a second consistent rule.
  `2, 4, 8, ?` is *not* a valid item: 16 (×2) and 14 (+2,+4,+6) are both defensible.
- **Distractor leakage** — the answer is recoverable from the option set alone, without the
  stimulus. The original RAVEN dataset had exactly this bug: distractors were made by
  perturbing one attribute of the answer, so the answer was the attribute-wise **mode** of the
  candidate set, and a model could score highly reading only the options.
  **I-RAVEN** fixed it with an attribute-bisection tree. Any generator here must too.

**U is enforced mechanically, not by inspection** — see §4.

Rows 29–37 are the batch drawn from *Brain Age* / *Dr Kawashima's Brain Training* (see the note in
§3). Their ⚠️s are all the same ⚠️ and all in **U**, never in G or V: a numeric answer with a small
neighbourhood invites distractors built by perturbing it, which is the RAVEN flaw in arithmetic
clothing. Four of the nine leaked on the first attempt and were measured, not argued, back into
range — §4 names each one. Row 29 is the exception worth reading: the source task compares two
numerals of *different digit counts*, which makes the answer the longer string and so leaks by
construction rather than by accident. It ships redesigned — both numerals always share a digit
count — because the size–value conflict is the construct and the digit count is not.

### Why the Gc items are rejected

This is the single most important judgement in the document, so it's worth being explicit.

Verbal analogies and vocabulary **cannot be procedurally generated with verifiable ground
truth**, because their correctness depends on semantic facts about a natural language that live
outside the generator. A program can emit `hot : cold :: up : ?` only if a human already encoded
that *hot/cold* and *up/down* are antonym pairs. That makes it a **content database with a
lookup key** — hand-authored items in a trenchcoat — which fails **V** as defined above.

Worse, it fails **U** unpredictably: for `up : ?` the intended answer is *down*, but *above*,
*upward*, and *raised* are all defensible depending on the relation inferred, and the generator
has no principled way to know. Distractor selection has the same problem — a randomly drawn
word may be an *equally valid* answer.

The honest consequence: **this site trains Gf, Gv, Gwm, Glr, Gs, Gt and Gq, and does not train Gc.**
That is stated on the site itself rather than papered over. Glr is worth a sentence, because it is the
domain that *looks* like Gc and is not: associative memory is the ability to bind two things that had
no reason to go together, so a format that pairs abstract symbols with boxes measures the binding
without needing a single fact about any language — the pairing is the generator's own choice, and
therefore its own ground truth. It also means the site cannot approximate a
Full Scale IQ even in principle, since VCI has no analogue here — which is fine, because §8 of
the knowledge doc already rules out reporting an IQ score at all.

Note that this asymmetry is *why* culture-fair batteries (Raven's, CFIT, NNAT) are purely
nonverbal, and why free online tests are almost universally matrix-based.

| `clock-spin` | read a clock face that has been turned | rotation; how late the minute hand sits |
| `calendar-count` | given one day, name the day another date falls on | direction of the count; crossing into the next month |
| `change-maker` | pick the fewest coins that make the change | coins in the answer; whether the amount reaches the 1s and 2s |

| `tower` | two Tower of London boards, how few moves between them, 4 options | length of the shortest solution (3–8), proved by search |
| `table-reasoning` | a 4-row table and one question about it, 4 options | columns (3–5); which questions are on the menu |
| `reaction-time` | five trials: wait, then press the target that lit; the median is recorded | number of targets (1–6), Hick's law |
| `go-no-go` | eight signals on one target; press the plain, withhold on the crossed | response window (1200–600 ms); run and stop count fixed |
| `chimp-test` | numerals scattered on a 5×4 grid, masked at the first tap, tapped in order | numerals to hold (4–8), and nothing else |

| `feature-match` | two panels of symbols in the same layout; same or different | symbols per panel (3–7) |
| `number-line` | a line with labelled ends; place the number (a `tap` board, graded by distance) | the line: 0–100-ish, 0–1000, off-zero start, fraction or decimal on the unit line, spanning zero; tolerance 6→4% |
| `gear-train` | wheels joined by teeth or belts, the first turning clockwise; which way and how fast does the last turn | wheels (2–5); belts enter at 3, crossed belts at 4 |
| `block-rotation` | a polycube and four more; which is the same object turned | blocks (5–9) and quarter-turns composed (1–3) |
| `cube-net` | six marked squares laid flat; which of five cubes folds from them | the cross net, then any of the eleven; distractors go from opposite-face pairs (4) to mirror-handed corners (4) |
| `pattern-recall` | a 4×4 grid flashes a set of cells; tap the set back | cells to hold (3–7), and nothing else |
| `paired-associates` | boxes open on symbols one by one; a filled 7 s interval; which box held this one? | pairings to learn (3–7) |

> - **`coding`** is a two-minute written sprint scored on completions. Here one item is one
>   substitution, scored on latency, so it measures substitution speed and not the sustained
>   output a timed page adds.
>
> Both now have that option: the **continuous timed block** ships as `sprint` mode — one format,
> a fixed window, items back to back under a single running clock, scored on output per minute. It
> does not replace the untimed drill, and the two are deliberately never pooled: a sprint's
> latencies measure how fast a reader *chose* to go and its accuracy is pushed down by the

> them in their own units. Pooling them would have moved every per-type median the first time
> anyone sprinted, with nothing on screen to say the measurement had changed.
>
> A format opts in with `meta.sprintable`, and the bar is narrow: one item answerable in a couple
> of seconds. A format carrying a `presentation` can never qualify, since the block would be spent
> watching — asserted in `tests/generators.test.ts` rather than left to reviewer discipline.
>
> The block was also the prerequisite named here for the speeded formats that were then unbuilt.

> **On the 2026-09 batch, drawn from a gap analysis.** Five formats — rows 38–42 — came from comparing

> (`table-reasoning`, the only format resembling the tests people actually sit for jobs).
>
> Rows 43–44 followed in the same month. `go-no-go` is Donders' *c*-reaction — the third of the
> 1868 trio, after the simple and choice reactions `reaction-time` already covered — and its response
> is a record rather than a choice: eight signals, pressed or withheld, graded as one string, with a

> masked-numerals task, and it fills the one cell the site's spatial spans left open: a set encoded
> at once *with* an order (block span is sequential; pattern recall is simultaneous but unordered).
> The same month `reaction-time` became a block of five trials per item with the median recorded as
> the item's latency, which is what the lab reports and cost an `ITEM_VERSION` bump — the first
> since the leakage pass — and `paired-associates` gained a filled retention interval (Brown–Peterson:
> a grid to tap for seven seconds between the last box and the probe), so the probe can no longer be

> syllogisms: relational constraints over shapes in a row, with an exhaustive search proving the
> asked place has one occupant and a pruning pass proving every clue is needed. It is the zebra
> puzzle with the vocabulary removed, which is the only way §2 lets a zebra puzzle in.
> Row 46, `feature-match`, is the clerical-checking task (Cambridge Brain Sciences' Feature Match,
> the old "number comparison" tests): two panels of symbols in the same layout, identical or differing
> in exactly one pair by exactly one feature, so that the difference has to be found by comparing
> rather than seen at a glance. It is the seventh Gs format and, like `symbol-search`, sprintable.
> Row 47, `cube-net`, was the top of the v2 list (row 19) and turned out to cost a day: the net is
> folded by *rolling* a cube across it, which finds the eleven nets by folding every hexomino rather
> than typing them in, and the same routine decides the answer. A picture of a cube shows three faces
> at a corner, and a corner has a handedness — so a wrong option is either two opposite faces shown
> together (`opposite-faces`, a new error type) or the right three faces the other way round
> (`mirror`), and the ladder trades the first kind for the second one distractor at a time. The face
> marks are all symmetric under a quarter turn, a deliberate narrowing of the DAT item so that the
> corner's handedness is the whole task rather than one of two.
> Row 48, `number-line`, is the first response graded by *distance* rather than identity: the mark
> is right within the level's tolerance of the true place, both in thousandths of the line, and the
> mark itself is what is stored, so the review says by how much and which way — and the direction is
> the diagnosis, two new error types `overshoot` and `undershoot`. It rides the `tap`
> response mode — a board that owns its surface and hands back a string — with one branch in
> `isCorrect` for the tolerance, rather than a sixth mode. Targets are kept further than the tolerance
> from the ends and the midpoint, the three places a reader can hit without estimating.
> Row 49, `block-rotation`, is Shepard and Metzler's task itself, and the second item off the v2 list
> (row 20). The 24 rotations of the cube are generated from two quarter-turns and counted by a test;
> chirality is exhaustive comparison against the mirror image under all of them; the drawing is the
> isometric projection from `cube-geometry` painted back to front. Two constraints came from the blind
> solver's point of view before it was run: every option is a distinct object up to rotation (so no
> two can be paired off as the same shape), and the one-block-moved distractors keep the answer's
> cube count and sorted bounding-box extents (so no count or measurement separates them).
> Three of the five are `tap` boards that own their own presentation, like `block-span`, and each has a
> **computed** diagnosis of its own: a press before the signal is `premature` (a new error type, the
> only one that names anticipation rather than a wrong answer); a tapped cell adjacent to a missed one
> is `off-by-one` in two dimensions; the box next door to the right one is `off-by-one` too, the
> associative slip. Two things in the batch were changed by the blind solver rather than by design:
> `tower` does not ask for two-move items, because an answer of two in a run of four with a floor of
> one can only be the smallest or second-smallest option and "pick the smallest" scored 42%; and
> `table-reasoning` does not offer the neighbouring row's total as a distractor, however diagnostic,
> because with a fixed ±10 carry pair beside it the solver found the answer six times in ten by looking
> for the unique pair ten apart. The neighbouring total is named in the explanation instead.
>
> Row 50, `gear-train`, is the one corner of mechanical reasoning that generates. The family never
> had a row in §2 because the Bennett and DAT items are drawings of everyday physics with a question in
> words — neither the drawing nor the question is generatable — but a gear train is a chain with two rules, direction reversing at every mesh and crossed belt and speed
> multiplying by the size ratio at every link, and both are computed rather than asserted. The

>
> One honest limit, stated on the format: `paired-associates` probes seconds after learning. The fuller
> Glr measurement is the same probe minutes later, and a practice drill of the format now builds it:
> after its learning items it appends one `pairs-delayed` item per set, regenerated from the source
> item's seed and asking a different box, so the answer is retrieval from storage rather than a repeat
> of one. The probe is *scheduled*, not offered — generatable by id and counted on the progress page,
> but absent from the registry, since a delayed question on its own is a question about nothing.
> `block-rotation`'s ladder was built with the read-out in mind: turns per level is a fixed mapping,
> so the progress page regresses median correct latency on turn count for a **rotation rate** in
> milliseconds per quarter-turn — Shepard and Metzler's slope, by the same code that reads Hick's.
> The cube count rises with the level too, so the slope is turns-plus-complexity, and the copy says
> so rather than pretending otherwise.
>
> The six Gwm ladders are spans, and the progress page now says so in each format's unit — the
> **span profile** (`src/lib/spans.ts`) maps peak level back through each generator's own `planFor`,
> so "level 4" on `span` reads as six digits backward. A ceiling reached once rather than an
> estimated span; the copy is explicit that the ladder is not a span procedure.
>
> At forty formats the full test is a long sitting, so a **short test** now sits beside it: seven
> items, one per domain, the format standing for each drawn from the session seed (`onePerDomain`).
> It keeps the property the full test was derived-length to guarantee — every domain reached — and
> trades exhaustive coverage for a run a reader will actually repeat, on a new draw each time.
>
> The progress page reads the two halves against each other as a **retention contrast** — immediate
> accuracy, delayed accuracy, and the drop — the third read-out that is a difference rather than a

> learning* rather than in condition.

> **On the fifth response mode.** `fill` ships with `triangle-math`, and it is the first format
> whose item genuinely has more than one answer. Two alternatives were available and both were
> worse. One item per cell would create items whose answers are *not independent* — a cell you got

>
> It is graded all-or-nothing, like a span, and for the same reason stated there: half a pyramid is
> not half an answer. It also cannot be, honestly — every cell above a mistake inherits it, so
> counting the inherited cells as separate failures would count one mistake several times.
>

Every generator implements one interface:

```ts
interface Generator {
  meta: ItemTypeMeta;               // language-neutral: id, CHC domain, icon
  generate(seed: string, difficulty: Difficulty, locale: Locale): Item;
}

interface Item {
  type: ItemTypeId;
  seed: string;          // reproduces this exact item
  difficulty: Difficulty;
  stimulus: Stimulus;    // structured, renders to SVG/text
  options: Option[];
  answerIndex: number;   // derived by construction, never hand-keyed
  explanation: Explanation; // the rule set, for post-answer review
}
```

### The five response modes

`Item` carries a `responseMode`, and the five values are not interchangeable ways of typing the same
answer — each one exists because a *grading* rule and a *diagnosis* rule follow from how the answer
was collected. Each has a note of its own further down; this is the summary.

| Mode | Answer | Correct means | Diagnosis | Formats |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| `choice` | an index into `options` | the index is the keyed one | **keyed** — the chosen distractor carries its own error type | 23 |
| `text` | `chosenText`, exact-matched | the string matches, whitespace-insensitively | **none** — a wrong string has nothing to attribute it to, and an absence is not a `plausible` | `span` |
| `trail` | a path over the targets | the run finished without a misclick | none; misclicks are counted and the *time* is the measurement | `trail-making` |
| `tap` | a sequence, in `chosenText` | the whole sequence matches, in order — except `number-line`, whose one string is a position graded by distance | **computed** from the response | `block-span` |
| `fill` | every blank, in `chosenText` | every blank matches, compared one by one | computed, and able to name a wrong *idea* | `triangle-math` |

Two consequences are load-bearing. **A mode without distractors has no Guard 2 to satisfy** — the
answer cannot leak from an option set that does not exist — which is why four of the five formats
`tests/leakage.test.ts` does not sweep are exactly the four non-`choice` modes. (The fifth is
`odd-one-out`, where the options *are* the stimulus, so a stimulus-blind solver has done the item
rather than bypassed it; the test says so at length.) And **`tap` and `fill` compute their diagnosis
rather than keying it**, which is the only way a format with no distractors can say more than
"wrong" — while `text` and `trail` record no diagnosis at all, and `tallyErrorTypes` drops them
instead of bucketing them as `plausible`, since an absence is not a finding.

`locale` is passed in but **must never be read before or between RNG draws**. It selects the
words, never the item: the same seed produces the same figures, the same option order and the
same `answerIndex` in every language, so a shared seed is the same test for an English and a
French reader. This is asserted directly in `tests/i18n.test.ts`.

The `explanation` field is a requirement, not a nicety: a training tool that says only
"wrong" teaches nothing. Because the generator *constructed* the item from an explicit rule
set, it can always state that rule set in full afterwards.

## 4. Enforcing unambiguity mechanically

The ⚠️ ratings above are discharged by three guards, applied in the generator and asserted in
the unit tests.

**Guard 1 — Solver check (kills under-determination).**
For rule-inference types (matrix, number series, letter series, figural analogy), the generator
runs an independent **solver** over the stimulus. It enumerates the rule space and collects
every rule consistent with the visible cells. If more than one *distinct predicted answer*
survives, the item is **rejected and regenerated**. This is what makes `2, 4, 8, ?` impossible
to emit: two consistent rules predict 16 and 14, so it never reaches the user.

The solver is deliberately a **separate implementation** from the generator. Verifying with the
same code that generated the item proves nothing.

**Guard 2 — Distractor-leakage check (the I-RAVEN fix).**
After building the option set, the generator asserts that the correct answer is **not**
recoverable from the options alone:

- no option is the attribute-wise mode of the set;
- no option is uniquely identifiable by any single attribute value;
- every distractor differs from the answer in a *rule-relevant* way (a near-miss), not by
  being obviously malformed.

Distractors are generated by the **error-type** taxonomy from Wang & Su — each distractor
encodes a specific plausible reasoning mistake (wrong rule applied, rule applied along the wrong
axis, correct rule off-by-one, right shape/wrong attribute). This makes wrong answers
*diagnostic*: the review screen can name the mistake the user probably made.

**Guard 3 — Structural invariants.**
Asserted on every generated item: exactly one `answerIndex`; all options pairwise distinct;
option order shuffled by the seeded RNG (so the answer position is uniform — no positional
tell); the stimulus renders without overlap; difficulty is within the requested band.

### Test strategy

The unit tests are **property-based over seeds**, not example-based. For each generator, 500+
seeds × each difficulty are generated and every invariant is asserted on all of them, plus:

- the independent solver recovers `answerIndex` for 100% of items (verifies **V**);
- a **distractors-only** solver, shown the options but *not* the stimulus, scores at chance
  (verifies Guard 2 — this is the direct regression test for the RAVEN flaw);
- the same seed produces a byte-identical item across runs (verifies reproducibility).

**Guard 2 is enforced centrally, in `tests/leakage.test.ts`, and that is a correction rather than a
refactor.** It used to be asserted per format, by hand, wherever someone had thought to. That failed
the way hand-written guards fail: each one tested the attack its author had in mind. The matrix guard
scored options by shared-value count — which its balanced attribute cube makes uniform *by
construction* — and so reported chance against a real leak of three times chance; the head-count
guard checked that every option was within ten of the answer, which is a fact about distance and says
nothing about rank, while the answer was the second-smallest of four in **every item the format had
ever produced**. Twelve of the fifteen multiple-choice formats were leaking when the sweep was first
run, several of them at four to five times chance.

The shared harness fixes the shape of the mistake, not just the instances. It runs a *family* of
stimulus-blind strategies — extremes, ranks, cluster centres, neighbour gaps, attribute-wise
majority, equivalence-class outliers — over generic features of the option list, and holds every
format to the best of them, per difficulty as well as pooled.

Two details make it trustworthy rather than merely strict. Ties are scored as ties: a strategy that
narrows five options to three earns a third of a guess, so "it cannot quite decide" is measured as
what it is. And the bar is **calibrated rather than assumed** — the same family is re-run against the
same option sets with the answer position replaced by an arbitrary one, and a format is asked to
score no better on its real answers than the family scores on invented ones. Raw chance would have
been the wrong bar in both directions: plausible near-miss distractors leave the answer near the
middle of the set often enough to beat 1/n on their own, and the maximum of fifty noisy estimators is
not an unbiased estimate of anything.

The harness shipped with one recorded allowance, for figural analogy at level 5, on the reading that
three simultaneous transformations leave too few attributes varying to spread. The reading was wrong
about the cause, which is the argument for measuring rather than reasoning: the bisect spread an
attribute only where *more than one* distractor still carried the answer's value, so the case where
exactly one did was skipped as though already balanced — leaving the answer's value the only one held
twice, and "pick either option from the one matched pair" a coin flip on a five-option item. The
repair is to state the invariant and check it: the answer's value must sit in a class whose size some
wrong value also has, on every attribute that varies. A set that cannot be arranged that way is
discarded rather than shown. **The allowance table is now empty, and the useful discipline is that an
allowance is a debt with a number on it rather than a permanent exemption.**

### The four leaks in the arithmetic batch, and the one repair they share

Every format in rows 29–37 was run through the harness before it shipped, and four of them failed.
They are worth recording together, because the four failures look unrelated and are not: in each one
**the answer was the sole member of a class the blind solver could see**, and in each one the repair
was to give some wrong value the same class size.

| Format | Measured | Baseline | What the blind solver found | Repair |
|--------|----------|----------|------------------------------|--------|
| `time-lapse` | 36.2% | 28.0% | "smallest of the set", at level 1 | A ten-minute answer could not offer three shorter intervals — five minutes is the floor — so it sat at a restricted rank. The answer now starts at four ticks, which is three steps of headroom. |
| `calendar-count` | 35.4% | 26.2% | "second largest" | Offering *both* ±1 weekdays put the answer in the middle of a run of three. One neighbour now, on a drawn side, and the filler is a uniformly drawn unused weekday. |
| `change-maker` | 39.6% | 26.0% | attribute-wise mode | Three handfuls each perturbing the answer left the answer as the mode of its own perturbations. Rebuilt as two *pairs*. |
| `change-maker` | 33.3% | 26.0% | nearest to the centroid | The residual, after the pairs: a swap touching the largest coin changed the option string's first character, re-singling the answer out. No swap touches the leading coin, and every option shares it. |

`high-number` never reached the harness with the flaw it would have failed on, because the flaw was
visible in the design: see row 29.

The general shape is the one I-RAVEN named, and it does not care whether the attributes are figural
or numeric. **Class-size balance** is the invariant — the answer must not be the unique member of any
class the option set exposes — and satellites orbiting an answer are the reliable way to violate it.

---

## 5. Consequences for the product

- **No IQ score is reported.** No norms exist. The site reports accuracy, median response time,
  and progress per item type. (`IQ-TESTS.md` §8.)
- **Practice effects are disclosed in-app**, since drilling matrix reasoning is precisely the
  format with the largest known practice gains (~5–15 points on retest), and improvement on the
  site is improvement at *the task*, not evidence of raised *g*.
- **Every item is generated, never stored.** A seed string reproduces an item exactly, so a
  session is persisted as `(seed, type, difficulty, response, latency)` — a few bytes — and can
  be replayed for review. This also means there is no item bank to leak.
- **Zero copyright exposure.** No Wechsler, Raven's, or CFIT item is reproduced; the *formats*
  are described in the public literature and are not themselves protectable. Trade marks are a
  separate constraint from copyright: product names may be used *descriptively* ("the format
  used in Raven's Progressive Matrices") but never as this site's own product name.
  See `IQ-TESTS.md` §9.
- **Difficulty is designed, not calibrated.** The five bands come from published cognitive
  operators (ANSIG for series, rule-count and rule-abstractness for matrices, angle for
  rotation), which is a defensible *a priori* ordering — Arendasy & Sommer report those
  operators explaining ~77% of difficulty variance. It is still not an **IRT calibration**: no
  item has an estimated difficulty or discrimination parameter fitted to response data, so the
  adaptive ladder is a 3-up/2-down staircase, not an ability estimator. Anything resembling a
  θ estimate, a percentile, or a CAT claim would require data this project deliberately does not
  collect (`IQ-TESTS.md` §7.1).

---

## 6. Two roads not taken, and why

### 6.1 Open item banks (ICAR)

The **International Cognitive Ability Resource** is a public-domain, IRT-calibrated bank
(matrix reasoning, letter–number series, 3-D rotation, verbal reasoning) with published item
parameters — the only realistic source of *externally calibrated* items for a project like this.
It was considered and not used:

- It is a **fixed bank of a few dozen items**. Its parameters are valid only for a first,
  unrehearsed exposure; a drilling site burns through it in one session and then trains
  recall of specific items — the exact failure mode generation exists to avoid.
- ICAR16/ICAR60 items are already widely published online, so they are partly leaked.
- Its calibration would still not yield norms for *this* population and administration.

It remains the right reference if the project ever wants a **single, one-shot, calibrated
baseline** distinct from the practice drills, and it is properly licensed for that.

### 6.2 High-range / open-response items

High-range tests buy resolution above ~145 with untimed administration and open (drawn or typed)
responses instead of multiple choice — see `IQ-TESTS.md` §3.9. Two of those properties are
genuinely attractive here:

- **Open response removes guessing entirely**, which makes Guard 2 (distractor leakage)
  unnecessary rather than merely satisfied. The site already does this wherever the answer space is
  canonically representable: digit span is free-text and exact-match scored, block span is a tapped
  sequence, and the number pyramid is several numbers written into a diagram. Those three and the
  trail are the formats Guard 2 has nothing to say about, which is a property of the response mode
  and not a concession — see §3.
- **Compound rules** (several simultaneous transformations, boolean shape algebra) are exactly
  what the difficulty-5 band is already reaching for.

What is rejected is the rest of the package: **untimed power items** turn the construct into
persistence plus free time, and **unnormed self-selected "norms"** are how HRTs produce the
inflated numbers this project refuses to produce at all. So: open response where the answer is
canonically representable, yes; the HRT scoring culture, no.

A generalised open-response mode for figural items (draw/assemble the missing cell) is feasible
— the generator already knows the answer as a structured object, so scoring is a deep-equality
check, not a rubric — and is the main untapped design space. It is v2 work, gated on an input
affordance that is usable on a phone.
