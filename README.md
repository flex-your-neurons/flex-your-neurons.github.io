# Flex Your Neurons — training on reasoning-test item formats

*Muscle Tes Neurones* in French. The name is translated per locale, title-cased in both; the URL
slug stays English.

A static site for practising the item formats used in IQ and aptitude tests, **in English and
French**. Every item is **generated from a seed**, **proved to have exactly one defensible
answer**, and **explained afterwards**. It runs entirely in the browser, stores everything in
localStorage, and deploys to GitHub Pages.

It deliberately reports **no IQ score**. See [Why there is no score](#why-there-is-no-score).

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:4321/flex-your-neurons/ — redirects to /flex-your-neurons/en/ or /flex-your-neurons/fr/

npm test               # unit tests (generators, solvers, rng, geometry, the leakage harness)
npm run build          # static output in dist/
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright, against the built site
npm run test:all       # everything, in the order CI runs it
```

Node 22.12+ is required (Astro 7).

## The forty formats

| Format | CHC | Verification |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Matrix reasoning | Gf | Independent solver over the rule space + leakage-balanced options |
| Number series | Gf | Independent sequence solver; ambiguous sequences are regenerated |
| Letter series | Gf | Same solver, over alphabet positions |
| Odd one out | Gf | Every figure checked; exactly one may be defensibly odd |
| Figural analogy | Gf | Every transformation must be visible in *both* pairs |
| Syllogisms | Gf | Exhaustive model checking over all 256 models — provable |
| Logic grid | Gf | Every arrangement tried against the clues; the asked place has one occupant, every clue is necessary, and none states the answer |
| Tower (of London) | Gf | Minimum move count proved by breadth-first search over all 36 board states |
| Mental rotation | Gv | Chirality proved; exactly one option is a rotation |
| Gear train | Gv | Direction by counting reversals (meshes and crossed belts), speed by the product of size ratios; the ratio is never 1 |
| Block rotation | Gv | Shepard–Metzler in 3-D: chirality proved over all 24 rotations; the mirror and two one-block moves share count and extents with the answer |
| Paper folding | Gv | The unfolding is simulated, not asserted |
| Cube net | Gv | The net is folded by rolling; the eleven nets are found, not typed; one option is right-handed |
| Turned clock | Gv | The time is recovered by undoing the rotation on the drawn hand angles |
| Pattern recall | Gv | Tapped set compared as a fixed-width bitmask; nameable patterns (full row, filled block) rejected |
| Figure weights | Gf | Every candidate group weighed; exactly one may balance — decidable |
| Digit span | Gwm | Exact string match, whitespace-insensitive |
| Block span | Gwm | The tapped sequence must match the one shown, exactly and in order |
| Number line | Gq | Graded by distance: right within the level's tolerance of the true place; targets kept off the ends and midpoint |
| Chimp test | Gwm | The tapped cells must be the numerals' cells in ascending order; layouts in reading order are redrawn |
| N-back | Gwm | Match count re-derived from the finished stream |
| Head count | Gwm | Total re-accumulated from the script; the room may never empty |
| Add what you saw | Gwm | The sum is re-added from the stream; no term repeats and some pair must carry |
| Delayed recall (scheduled) | Glr | A paired-associates drill appends one probe per set after the learning; regenerated from the source seed, different box |
| Paired associates | Glr | Every box's symbol distinct by rendered signature; the probe, after a filled interval, is one of them and the box is the key |
| Symbol search | Gs | Membership re-checked after shuffling |
| Feature match | Gs | Panels re-compared by rendered signature; a difference is exactly one pair, one feature |
| Digit–symbol coding | Gs | Every option is a key entry; the pairing is re-looked-up |
| Trail making | Gs | Targets proved non-overlapping and inside the board; the order is printed on them |
| Count, don’t read (Stroop) | Gs | The keyed answer is the array length the renderer draws; both congruency conditions occur |
| Which is worth more | Gs | The keyed side holds the larger value; both congruency conditions occur at every level |
| Rock, paper, scissors | Gs | The keyed hand is re-derived from the cycle; all six items occur |
| Reaction time | Gt | A block of five trials; every lit target is the key, a press before any signal is a false start, and the median is the latency |
| Go / no-go | Gt | The run's record is compared signal by signal; a press on a crossed signal and a missed plain one are named apart |
| Mental arithmetic | Gq | The displayed expression is re-evaluated; two options share the answer's units digit |
| Counting down | Gq | The printed chain is re-walked; two options share the answer's units digit |
| Time passed | Gq | The interval is re-derived from the two faces, in minutes past midday |
| Counting the days | Gq | The day is re-derived by parsing the printed lines; the item names no real date |
| Making change | Gq | The coins are re-totalled from the printed amounts, and minimality proved by exhaustive search |
| Number pyramid | Gq | Every cell re-derived from the base; the blanks are compared one by one, not as one string |
| Table reasoning | Gq | The keyed value re-derived by parsing the printed question against the printed cells |

Seven CHC domains: **Gf 9, Gv 7, Gwm 6, Glr 1 (plus a scheduled delayed probe), Gs 7, Gt 2, Gq 8** — and no Gc at all, which is a
limit of generation rather than an oversight and is the reason no Full Scale figure is even
approximable. Glr and Gt arrived in 2026-09 with the gap analysis against *Brain Age*, Human
Benchmark and Cambridge Brain Sciences: associative memory can be generated where vocabulary cannot,
because its pairings are arbitrary by construction, and reaction time is the one Gt measurement that
needs nothing but a clock.
Nine of these formats come from *Brain Age* / *Dr Kawashima's Brain Training*, several of which are
lab tasks in game clothing; what made them worth taking is that they were built for a small screen,
a few seconds an item, and no examiner. `docs/GENERATABILITY.md` §3 records which of the game's
exercises could not be taken, and why.

## The five ways to answer

Most formats offer options and take one click. Four do not, and each is a mode rather than a special
case, because how an answer is *collected* decides how it can be graded and explained.

| `responseMode` | How it is answered | Graded on | Used by |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------|---------|
| `choice` | pick one option | the keyed index | 23 formats |
| `text` | type it | exact match, whitespace-insensitive | digit span |
| `trail` | join the targets in order | finishing without a misclick — the *time* is the measurement | trail making |
| `tap` | tap the sequence back | the whole sequence, in order | block span |
| `fill` | fill every blank | every blank, compared one by one | number pyramid |

`trail`, `tap` and `fill` are also the three formats whose response *surface* is part of the task,
so their boards live in the answer tray rather than in `StimulusView`: the blanks have to sit in the
pyramid, above the numbers they are sums of.

`tap` and `fill` grade all-or-nothing, and `fill` has the strongest reason to: every cell above a
mistake inherits it, so counting the inherited cells separately would count one mistake several
times. Both also *compute* their diagnosis from the response rather than keying it to a distractor,
which is the only way a format with no distractors can say more than "wrong" — a pyramid built by
subtracting throughout is one wrong idea, not five careless slips.

## The three modes

| Mode | Ends when | Scored on | Difficulty |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Practice | a set number of items | accuracy, with an explanation after each answer | adapts as you go |
| Full test | every format has been seen once | accuracy by format, no feedback until the end | adapts as you go |
| Sprint | the clock runs out | correct answers per minute | pinned for the whole block |

A sprint is the continuous timed block: one format, a fixed window, items back to back with no
explanation until the end. Only formats whose items are answerable in a couple of seconds opt in
(`meta.sprintable`), and a format that plays a sequence before it can be answered can never opt in.

Sprint results are kept strictly apart from the practice and test statistics. A sprint's latencies
measure how fast you *chose* to go and its accuracy is pushed down by the clock, so pooling the two
would have moved every per-format median the first time anyone sprinted without saying so.

### The one measurement that is a difference

Every other figure this site reports is a tally — how many right, how fast, how often. The
interference score is a contrast: incongruent trials minus congruent ones on the counting-Stroop
format. Neither half means much alone, but everything about the two conditions is identical except
the conflict, so the gap is a property of inhibition specifically.

It also came for free. Congruency was never stored on a response; it is a property of the item, and
every item regenerates exactly from its seed — so the partition is re-derived when the page is read,
out of history written before the read-out existed.

### The one measurement that is a time

The reaction-time block is the one format whose latency is the measurement rather than a by-product
of it: the board hands the quiz the block's median trial, and the progress page reports the median
of those medians as simple reaction time, plus Hick's slope in milliseconds per bit read off your
own levels. Beside it, go / no-go is counted by kind of failure — commissions apart from omissions —
because pressing on a crossed signal and missing a plain one do not come from the same place.

## How an item is made safe

Three guards, described in full in [`docs/GENERATABILITY.md`](docs/GENERATABILITY.md) §4:

1. **A separate solver must agree.** It re-derives the rule from what is visible and lists
   every rule that fits. Two fitting rules that disagree ⇒ the item is thrown away. This is
   why `2, 4, 8, ?` can never be emitted: ×2 predicts 16 and a growing gap predicts 14.
2. **The options must not leak the answer.** Matrix options form an attribute-balanced cube,
   so no single-attribute statistic identifies the answer — the flaw I-RAVEN found in RAVEN.
   A test plays that exact shortcut and asserts it scores at chance.
3. **Wrong answers must be wrong for a nameable reason** (rule applied down the columns,
   off by one step, a cell copied), so the explanation can diagnose the mistake.

Guard 2 is enforced centrally rather than per format, by a stimulus-blind solver that tries ~50
strategies over the option set and is held to a baseline measured on invented answers — because a
hand-written leakage guard only ever tests the attack its author had in mind. When that harness was
first run, twelve of the fifteen multiple-choice formats were leaking, several at four to five times
chance. The allowance table is empty; four of the nine newest formats leaked on the first attempt and
each repair is recorded, with its numbers, in `docs/GENERATABILITY.md` §4.

The four formats that collect an answer instead of offering one — digit span, block span, the trail,
the pyramid — have no option set for Guard 2 to examine; the structural invariants still apply. Guard
3 is where they pay for it instead: a tapped sequence and a filled pyramid compute their diagnosis
from the response, and a typed span and a trail record none at all rather than filing every mistake
under "plausible", because an absence is not a finding.

## Why there is no score

A real IQ score is a comparison against a representative, age-matched standardisation sample
under standardised administration. No website has that. Reporting "IQ 132" after ten questions
would be a fabrication.

Also worth knowing, and stated in the app itself:

- **Practice effects are large** — 5–15 points on a second administration, largest for novel
  formats like matrix reasoning, which is exactly what this site drills. Training improves
  test performance; there is no good evidence it raises *g*.
- **Norms drift** (the Flynn effect, ~3 points/decade), which is why batteries are renormed
  every 15–20 years.
- **No verbal comprehension.** Verbal analogies and vocabulary cannot be procedurally
  generated with verifiable answers — their correctness lives in facts about a language, not
  in the generator. So Gc is untrained here, and a Full Scale IQ is not even approximable.
- **Difficulty is designed, not calibrated.** The five bands follow published cognitive
  operators, which is a defensible ordering — but no item has an IRT difficulty parameter fitted
  to real response data, so the adaptive ladder is a staircase, not an ability estimate.
- **Even a real IQ test leaves most of the mind unmeasured** — divergent creativity, emotional
  and social intelligence, practical judgement, and conscientiousness are all outside it.
- **Nothing is copied** from any published test. Item *formats* are described in the open
  literature; the items themselves are all generated. Test names are used descriptively
  ("the format used in Raven's Progressive Matrices"), never as a product claim.

## Languages

The site is available in **English (`/en/…`)** and **French (`/fr/…`)**. The root URL picks a
language from a previously stored choice, then `navigator.languages`, then English; a
`<noscript>` meta-refresh and visible links cover the case where that script never runs. Every
page carries a language switcher that keeps you on the same page.

Everything is translated: the interface, the page copy, and the generated items themselves —
prompts, rule explanations, and the syllogism premises, which need French grammar the English
templates cannot express ("Aucun Blick n'est un Zorn" needs a singular where "No Blicks are
Zorns" does not).

**Locale never touches the RNG.** A seed identifies an item; the language only decides how it
is described. Two people opening the same `?seed=` link get byte-identical figures, the same
options in the same order, and the same correct index, whichever language they read in. Both
`tests/i18n.test.ts` and `e2e/i18n.spec.ts` assert this directly.

Adding a language means adding one file next to `src/lib/i18n/fr.ts` and listing it in
`LOCALES`. `Dict` is inferred from the English dictionary with `typeof`, so **a missing key is
a compile error**, and a unit test additionally fails on any string that was copied across
untranslated. No i18n library is used; the reasoning is in
[`docs/LIBRARIES.md`](docs/LIBRARIES.md).

## Progress tracking

The progress page reports accuracy, median response time, streaks and per-type breakdowns,
plus charts of how those move over time: accuracy per session with a three-session rolling
average, median time per correct answer, an eight-week activity chart, and a trend
sparkline per item type. All hand-written SVG, themed, translated, and readable by
Playwright — see the note on charting libraries in [`docs/LIBRARIES.md`](docs/LIBRARIES.md).

Timing uses `performance.now()`, not `Date.now()`: wall-clock time jumps when the OS
adjusts it, which would write nonsense latencies into permanent history. The clock starts
when the item is painted — and for digit span, when playback ends, so the animation is not
counted as thinking time.

## Accessibility

Figures never encode information in hue. Shading levels are told apart by **texture** —
hollow, dots, hatch, cross-hatch, dense hatch, solid — each with its own background wash,
so two redundant cues carry the same information and neither depends on fine contrast
discrimination. Size levels follow a geometric ramp with a per-layout floor, so nothing is
ever drawn too small to judge. The densest layout drops the size rule entirely rather than
asking readers to compare shapes a few pixels apart.

Verdicts do not depend on hue either: a blank you filled in wrong is struck through and outlined as
well as recoloured, and the right number appears beside it — so the review reads on a monochrome
screen and for a reader who cannot separate the two.

Everything is operable from the keyboard, every option carries a text label, and both
themes are covered by tests. The boards that collect an answer are part of that: each pyramid cell
carries a screen-reader label saying which blank it is and how many there are, since "an input" in a
diagram is otherwise unlocatable by ear.

## Data

Everything lives in `localStorage` under `iq:v1:*`. There is no server and no network request.
Sessions store `(type, seed, difficulty, response, latency)` — never the items — because a seed
regenerates its item exactly. A full history is a few kilobytes, and can be exported, imported,
or deleted from the progress page.

Adding `?seed=ABC12345&d=3&n=10` to a practice or test URL replays an exact run — two people
opening the same link get byte-identical items, in either language.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` type-checks, runs the unit tests, builds, runs the Playwright
suite, and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

The site URL and base path are derived from the repository, so a fork deploys to its own URL
with no code change. Locally they default to `/iq`; override with `SITE_URL` and `BASE_PATH`.

Enable Pages once, under **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**.

## Testing notes

- Unit tests are **property-style**: each generator is swept over hundreds of seeds at every
  difficulty, asserting reproducibility, distinct options, a single correct key, no positional
  tell, and no distractor leakage. A generator is only as good as its worst seed.
- `tests/i18n.test.ts` checks the dictionaries have identical structure, that no string was
  left in English, and — the important one — that a seed yields a structurally identical item
  in every locale.
- E2E tests **import the generators in Node** to work out what the browser should be showing
  for a pinned seed, then assert against the rendered page. That makes them real end-to-end
  checks rather than "click something and hope".
- `e2e/rendering.spec.ts` exists because of a bug the other layers structurally could not
  catch: SVG presentation attributes were being emitted in camelCase, which browsers ignore,
  so every figure painted fully opaque and the shading attribute was invisible. Unit tests
  assert on data, not pixels; the other E2E tests compute the answer and click it, so they
  never needed the item to be *legible*. Those tests are verified to fail on the old code.
- Playwright runs against the built static site via `scripts/serve-static.mjs`, which mimics
  how GitHub Pages serves files. `astro preview` is not used: in Astro 7 it always detaches
  into a background daemon, which Playwright's `webServer` cannot manage.
- The E2E server uses port **4331**, not Astro's default 4321, and never reuses an existing
  server. A stray `astro dev` on 4321 was once picked up as the "existing server", so the
  suite quietly ran against the dev server instead of `dist` — and passed, while testing an
  artefact nobody was going to deploy.
