/**
 * Guard 2, enforced for every format at once.
 *
 * `docs/GENERATABILITY.md` §4 promises that the answer is never recoverable from the option set
 * alone — the I-RAVEN flaw, where distractors made by perturbing the answer leave the answer as the
 * attribute-wise mode of the candidates, and a solver that never reads the stimulus scores well.
 *
 * The promise was previously checked per format, by hand, in a handful of places. That failed in the
 * way hand-written guards fail: each one tested the attack its author had in mind, and several
 * tested an attack the design already precluded while a different one ran wide open. The matrix
 * guard scored options by shared-value count — which the balanced cube makes uniform by
 * construction — and reported chance against a real leak of three times chance.
 *
 * So this file does not ask "is the attack I thought of defeated?". It runs a *family* of
 * stimulus-blind strategies over generic features of the option list, takes the best one, and holds
 * every format to it. A strategy here may only look at `item.options`. It never sees the stimulus,
 * the prompt, the explanation, or the error types.
 *
 * Ties are scored honestly: a strategy that cannot separate k options gets 1/k credit rather than
 * being counted right or wrong on the coin-flip, so "guess among the two it narrowed to" is
 * measured as what it is.

/**
 * How far above the *calibrated* baseline a blind strategy may score.
 *
 * Raw chance is the wrong bar, and the reason is worth stating because it nearly produced a test
 * that failed honest formats and passed a leaky one. Two effects lift the best strategy above
 * 1/n even on a perfectly fair option set:
 *
 *  - **Plausibility itself.** A distractor has to sit near the answer or it can be dismissed on
 *    sight. Near-misses on both sides leave the answer near the middle of the set about half the
 *    time, so "closest to the others' mean" scores above 1/n against any set built this way.
 *  - **Taking the maximum of fifty strategies.** Each is an unbiased estimator of chance; the
 *    largest of fifty noisy estimates is not.
 *
 * So the baseline is measured rather than assumed: the same strategy family is run against the same
 * option sets with the answer position *replaced by an arbitrary one*. Whatever the family scores
 * there is what its structure and its multiplicity are worth, and a clean format should score no
 * better on the real answers than on the invented ones.

 * An allowance is a debt, not a dispensation: it says the leak is understood, bounded, and smaller

 *
 * Empty, and worth keeping empty. It held one entry — `analogy-figural` at difficulty 5, at 1.6 —
 * on the reading that three simultaneous transformations leave too few attributes varying to spread.
 * That reading was wrong about the cause. The leak was not scarcity, it was an unchecked assumption
 * in the bisect: it spread an attribute only where more than one distractor still carried the
 * answer's value, so the case where exactly one did — leaving the answer's value as the only one
 * held twice, a coin flip between two options — was skipped as though it were already balanced. The
 * generator now verifies the class sizes it was aiming for, and the format sits inside the ordinary
 * margin at every level. The debt was payable; it just had to be read correctly first.
