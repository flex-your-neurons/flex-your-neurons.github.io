/**
 * Sameness has to be judged on the ink, not on the record.
 *
 * `rotation` is a free number in the data model and a *quotient* on the page: a regular polygon
 * turned by one of its own symmetry steps is the same picture, and a square turned 45° is drawn as
 * the same four points as an upright diamond. Every generator that de-duplicates figures, builds a
 * lookup key, or asks "is this target present?" has to mean the drawn form.
 *
 * These are regressions for three shipped defects of exactly that shape:
 *
 *  - a coding key holding two visually identical symbols under different digits, so a reader who
 *    read the key perfectly was scored wrong;
 *  - a symbol-search trial keyed "target absent" while displaying a pixel-identical copy of one,
 *    which capped a flawless reader below the ceiling *and* removed the item from the latency
 *    median, because medians are taken over correct responses;
 *  - a figural analogy whose option list contained the answer twice.
 *
 * They are written against the rendered outline rather than against any generator's own notion of
 * identity, so a generator cannot satisfy them by agreeing with itself.
