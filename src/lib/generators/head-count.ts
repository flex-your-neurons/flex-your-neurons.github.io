/**
 * Head count — figures arrive and leave one step at a time; report how many remain.
 *
 * The third working-memory format, and it measures something the other two do not. Span
 * asks you to hold a list still and give it back. N-back asks you to keep a window of the
 * last few elements and rewrite it every step. This asks you to maintain a single *running
 * value* and update it — hold a total, add, subtract, discard the old total, hold the new
 * one. That is the classic tracking-and-updating load (`IQ-TESTS.md` §2), and it is the one
 * of the three where the thing being held is not the stimulus itself.
 *
 * ## Why departures are mandatory
 *
 * A stream of arrivals only would be a sum, and a sum can be accumulated without ever
 * discarding anything — arithmetic on a growing number, not updating. It is the *subtraction*
 * that forces the old total to be thrown away, so every item here contains at least one
 * departure.
 *
 * ## Why the room never empties, at any point
 *
 * Two separate reasons, and both had to be learned from rendered output.
 *
 * A script that goes *below* zero is not a hard item but an incoherent one — three figures
 * cannot leave a room holding two — and a reader who noticed would be right to stop trusting
 * the format. That much was obvious from the start.
 *
 * Reaching *exactly* zero mid-stream is subtler and was caught only by looking at the pinned
 * preview card, whose totals ran 1, 0, 3, 6. It is perfectly coherent, and it quietly destroys
 * the task: once the room is empty everything before that point is irrelevant, so the reader
 * can stop tracking and simply add up the rest. On that card the first two steps were
 * decoration. And a final total of zero is unusable for the n-back reason — "none left" is
 * where you land by never watching, indistinguishable from not having engaged.
 *
 * So the floor is one, held throughout, by construction rather than by filtering: a departure
 * is never drawn larger than `total - 1`.
