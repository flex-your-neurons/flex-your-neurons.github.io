/**
 * Math recall — the numbers go past, and only then are you asked to add them.
 *
 * The fourth working-memory format, and it is the one where the held material is *operated on*
 * rather than reproduced. Span gives a list back unchanged. Block span gives positions back
 * unchanged. Head count holds a single running value and rewrites it. This one holds several
 * independent values while they are still arriving and then computes over them once they are gone —
 * storage and processing at the same time, which is the distinction between short-term memory and
 * working memory proper (Baddeley; Daneman & Carpenter's operation-span line of work).
 *
 * ## Why the terms are shown one at a time rather than all at once and then hidden
 *
 * Flashing the whole sum and taking it away measures how much of a picture is captured in one look,
 * which is a visual span. Presenting term by term means the first number has to survive the arrival
 * of the second — there is no moment at which the reader can see the problem — and that is the load
 * the format is for.
 *
 * ## Why it is addition, and why the running sum is not the task
 *
 * Addition is commutative and associative, so the order the terms arrived in does not have to be
 * held as well as the terms; the item measures retention, not sequencing, which `span` already does.
 * And nothing on screen says how many terms are still coming, so a reader who adds as they go has
 * not cheated — they have solved it a different way, and both routes load the same thing. What the
 * format rules out is the third route: waiting to see the whole sum, which never appears.
 *
 * ## Why the answer is picked rather than typed
 *
 * The same reason as `arithmetic`: typing puts keyboard speed inside a measurement that is not about
 * it. The option set is a rectangle around the answer, which closes the units-digit shortcut — with
 * the terms gone, an option list where only one value could end in the right digit would be
 * answerable from a fragment of what was seen.
