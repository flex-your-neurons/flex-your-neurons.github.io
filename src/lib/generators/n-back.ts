/**
 * N-back — watch a stream go past and count the repeats N places apart.
 *
 * The canonical working-memory (Gwm) updating task, and the one place this site can measure
 * *updating* rather than *storage*. Span asks you to hold a list still and give it back;
 * n-back asks you to keep a window of the last N elements and rewrite it on every step,
 * which is a different thing and the reason both formats belong here (`IQ-TESTS.md` §2).
 *
 * ## Why counting, and not the usual per-element response
 *
 * A lab n-back shows one element per second for minutes and collects a hit/miss on *every*
 * element, scoring d-prime over the block. That needs a continuous timed block, which this
 * site's one-item-one-response loop does not have — `PLAN-2026-08` §2.3 records that a real
 * per-item deadline was deliberately never built.
 *
 * So one item is one short stream and one question: how many matches went past. This keeps
 * the construct that matters — you cannot count matches without maintaining and updating the
 * N-window, and you cannot do it after the fact because the stream is gone — while fitting a
 * single response. What it gives up is the per-element sensitivity a d-prime buys: a reader
 * who loses the window mid-stream and guesses the count may still land on it. Recorded here
 * rather than in the copy, because it is a property of the adaptation, not of the item.
 *
 * ## Why the count is bounded away from zero
 *
 * "No matches" is a legitimate stream but a terrible item: it is the answer you reach by not
 * watching at all, and it cannot be told apart from a total failure to engage. Every stream
 * here carries at least one match.
