/**
 * Block span — watch a scatter of blocks light one after another, then tap them back in order.
 *
 * Corsi's block-tapping task (1972), and the spatial counterpart of digit span: the same
 * "hold a list and reproduce it" demand with the list made of *places* rather than of characters.
 * The two dissociate — spatial and verbal span load differently, and someone strong at one is not
 * reliably strong at the other — which is the whole reason for adding a second span format instead
 * of another difficulty level on the first.
 *
 * ## Why the board never changes
 *
 * Every item uses the same nine positions. That is not laziness about generation, it is the
 * measurement: if the layout were redrawn per item, a reader would have to *find* the blocks before
 * they could remember an order among them, and the search would be mixed into the span. Holding the
 * board fixed makes the sequence the only thing that varies, and a familiar board is what the
 * physical apparatus gives you too — the examiner does not rearrange it between trials.
 *
 * It is the same argument as the fixed keypad in the interference format, arrived at from the other
 * direction: there, a moving option list would have added a search to a latency measurement; here, a
 * moving board would add one to a span measurement.
 *
 * ## Why difficulty is length and nothing else
 *
 * Three temptations were all refused, and each one would have made level 5 measure a different
 * construct from level 1 rather than more of the same one:
 *
 * - **Presentation rate.** Flashing faster at the high levels would trade a storage demand for an
 *   encoding-speed demand, so a longer sequence and a shorter look would be confounded.
 * - **Backward recall.** A backward spatial span is a genuinely harder task, not a longer one. Mixed
 *   into the ladder it would make accuracy at a level bimodal — the same number recalled forwards or
 *   backwards are not the same item — and unlike trail making's two forms there is no timed contrast
 *   to redeem the variance, because this format is scored right or wrong.
 * - **Block count.** Nine blocks with a five-long sequence and five blocks with a five-long sequence
 *   differ in how much of the board is irrelevant, which is a selection demand rather than a span.
 *
 * So `planFor` sets one number. See docs/GENERATABILITY.md §2 (row 20).
