 * The ladder used to move three things at once — length 4→7, rate 1000→800 ms, and the alphabet from
 * digits to letters at the top rung — while the docs and the on-screen description promised only
 * that "sequences lengthen as difficulty rises". Two of those three were the drifts this repo's own
 * design notes forbid elsewhere:
 *
 *  - **Rate** trades storage against encoding speed, which is a different construct. `block-span`'s
 *    design note rules it out in as many words; the same argument applies to its sibling.
 *  - **Alphabet** changes phonological similarity, so difficulty 5 was a different task from
 *    difficulty 4 rather than a longer one — and difficulty 5 is the level `peakDifficulty` reports
 *    on, which makes it the number most likely to be read as "my span is seven".
 *
 * What remains is length, and the forward/backward condition — which is a genuine second dimension,
 * introduced once at level 3 and held from there, so no level is a mixture of the two.
