/**
 * Pinned preview items — one real, generated item per format, drawn at build time.
 *
 * These exist because of a plain usability failure: an emoji and a sentence do not tell
 * you what a "paper folding" item *looks like*, so choosing a format was guesswork until
 * you had committed to one. The fix is to show the thing itself.
 *
 * The seed and difficulty are pinned rather than random for three reasons: the cards must
 * be byte-identical on every build (a shifting home page reads as instability), the
 * preview must be legible at ~10rem rather than merely valid, and a pinned pair can be
 * tuned by hand when a format draws badly. Difficulty sits low on purpose — a level-5
 * matrix carries five simultaneous rules, which at thumbnail size is noise.
 *
 * Nothing here is a second renderer or a second generator: `previewItem` calls the same
 * `generateItem` the quiz does, so a card cannot drift from the product it advertises.
